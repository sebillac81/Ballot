# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
yarn hardhat compile
yarn hardhat test
yarn run ts-node --files .\scripts\Deployment.ts Proposal1 Proposal2 Proposal3
```
